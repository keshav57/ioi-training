ioi-training
============

This repository initially began when I was mentoring Malvika Joshi for her preparations with the International Olympiad in Informatics. Currently, this repository is used in conjunction with an [IOI community](http://alpha.commonlounge.com/community/e4aac00a033a40ec96657906c6e1b43c) on [Commonlounge](http://commonlounge.com/). If you are interested in preparing for the IOI (or are interested in competitive programming / algorithms), I encourage you to join the community. If you are an IOI alumni or have competitive programming experience, we would love for you to help us by making contributions, answering peoples questions, or moderating the community.
